## Plagiarism-enabled text editor

Okay, writing an essay? But wouldn't it be great if you had marginalia from
wikipedia, perhaps the meaning of those fiddly academic words, and a word
count?

So, let's do that automatically. That sounds like a useful step 1. We're
probably going to end up with quite a lot of marginalia, so the ability to
prioritise which marginalia to show sounds like a useful 1b.

Okay, that sounds good, but what's next? What kicked this off, and what I will
be returning to, is GPT-2. I scratched the surface of GPT-2 and had a lot of
fun, but I would like to be able to train it using course material, wikipedia
articles, and in general all of the content from (1), and have it guess next
sentences.
